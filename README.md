Here is my first application : The Brick Game. 
I did it for entertainment and practice. I code on Android Studio in Java and XML.
The purpose of the game is to survive in a break brick game. You have a ball which bounce on the screen and you have rectangle that you can drag and the purpose is to never let the ball fall under the rectangle. Upper the rectangle bricks spawn randomly and if the ball touches a brick the brick will be destroyed.
There is a music on the application and I advise you to shut it as soon as possible in the setting activity.
Don't be too harsh with my code, this is my first application and my first use of Android Studio.  

What do I want to do next : 
Priority :
- add a score text, which will be inscreased everytime a brick is destroyed
- add an indentifier and a user section with a name (pseudo) and a highscore TextView

Less priority :
- add animation on brick destruction
- add sound effect on button pressed and during the game activity (and possibility to shut it on setting activity)

Even less priority : 
- add a growing difficulty (the difficulty never change) by reducing the playable rectangle or increasing the ball speeds or adding new balls
- possibility to target with the rectangle. If the ball bounces on the middle the rebound will not be changed and if the ball bounces on an extremity the angle will be increased 

Enjoy!
